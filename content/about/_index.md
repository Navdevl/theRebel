# This is Naveen, yo.

<p>
I am a old-fashioned guy who loves to collect quotes, get excited on sappy-things like friend calling at 12'o clock on your birthday and so on. Now you can imagine a hint of my character, right? Cool.

# Favorite TV shows.
<p> 
**Breaking Bad** Likes Jesse Pinkman more than W.W. Still W.W is a kickass character.

**F.R.I.E.N.D.S** Chandler is the best. Meh.

**Game of Thrones** Who doesn't like it, bruh.

```I'll update this when I am bored. Bugs to fix.```

# How to initiate a conversation with me.?
<p> 
**One Rule**. Don't talk about Kardashians or anything stupid. Yes Kardashians are stupid.
